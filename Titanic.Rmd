This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


### Set working directory here.
```{r, include=TRUE}

# For Home
#setwd("C:/R/Kaggle ToolSet/WIP")

# For Office
setwd("C:/R")

## One way to Load the data is through file explorer
#Titanic_TrainData <- read.csv(file.choose()) 
#Titanic_TestData <- read.csv(file.choose())
```

### Here we use Read the CSV File
```{r, include=TRUE}
Titanic_Data <- read.csv("Titanic Train.csv")  
Titanic_Test <- read.csv("Titanic Test.csv")
## sep = ";" (if separated by Colon) - lot of options for this command, Refer Help.
```


## Attribute Information:
>VARIABLE DESCRIPTIONS:
>survival        Survival            (0 = No; 1 = Yes)
>pclass          Passenger Class     (1 = 1st; 2 = 2nd; 3 = 3rd)
>name            Name
>sex             Sex
>age             Age
>sibsp           Number of Siblings/Spouses Aboard
>parch           Number of Parents/Children Aboard
>ticket          Ticket Number
>fare            Passenger Fare
>cabin           Cabin
>embarked        Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)

>SPECIAL NOTES:
>Pclass is a proxy for socio-economic status (SES)
> 1st ~ Upper; 2nd ~ Middle; 3rd ~ Lower

>Age is in Years; Fractional if Age less than One (1)
> If the Age is Estimated, it is in the form xx.5

>With respect to the family relation variables (i.e. sibsp and parch)
>some relations were ignored.  The following are the definitions used
>for sibsp and parch.

>Sibling:  Brother, Sister, Stepbrother, or Stepsister of Passenger Aboard Titanic
>Spouse:   Husband or Wife of Passenger Aboard Titanic (Mistresses and Fiances Ignored)
>Parent:   Mother or Father of Passenger Aboard Titanic
>Child:    Son, Daughter, Stepson, or Stepdaughter of Passenger Aboard Titanic

>Other family relatives excluded from this study include cousins,
>nephews/nieces, aunts/uncles, and in-laws.  Some children travelled
>only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.  As well, some
>travelled with very close friends or neighbors in a village, however,
>the definitions do not support such relations.

### Quick look at the dataset
```{r, include=TRUE}
str(Titanic_Data)
head(Titanic_Data)
tail(Titanic_Data)
# Assign the Titanic_TrainDate to a Data Frame (df)
df <- Titanic_Data
```

## Find out if any column value is missing.
```{r, include=TRUE}
anyNA(df)
any(is.na(df))
```
False means there is nothing missing. True means the data file has empty values.

# Find out the count of missing values (NA)
```{r, include=TRUE}
sapply(df, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
```

# Grab only numeric columns
```{r, include=TRUE}
num.cols <- sapply(df, is.numeric)
str(num.cols)
```

 
# Import Library for spliting
## Let us split the TrainData File into Train, Validate.
```{r, include=TRUE}
library(caTools)

# Set a random see so your "random" results are the same as this notebook
set.seed(101) 

# Split up the sample, basically randomly assigns a booleans to a new column "sample"
sample <- sample.split(df$Survived, SplitRatio = 0.70) # SplitRatio = percent of sample==TRUE

# Training Data
Titanic_Train = subset(df, sample == TRUE)

# Testing Data
Titanic_Valid = subset(df, sample == FALSE)
```


# Check the split
```{r, include=TRUE}
str(Titanic_Train)
str(Titanic_Valid)
# We have already populated the Titanic_test in the begining
str(Titanic_Test)
```

# Write the Train, Validate, Test Datasets in a file as a backup.
```{r, include=TRUE}
write.csv(Titanic_Train, file = "Titanic_Train.CSV")
write.csv(Titanic_Valid, file = "Titanic_Valid.CSV")
# We have already populated the Titanic_test in the begining
write.csv(Titanic_Test, file  = "Titanic_Test.CSV")
```
